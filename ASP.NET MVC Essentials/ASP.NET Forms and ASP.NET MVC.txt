Major differences & similarities between ASP.NET Forms and ASP.NET MVC:

1. ASP.NET Web Forms uses Page controller pattern approach for rendering layout. In this approach, every page has it’s own controller i.e. code-behind file that processes the request.
1. ASP.NET MVC uses Front Controller approach. That approach means ,a common controller for all pages, processes the requests.

2. ASP.NET Web Forms: No separation of concerns. Every page (.aspx) has it’s own controller (code behind i.e. aspx.cs), so both are tightly coupled.
2. ASP.NET MVC: Very clean separation of concerns. View and Controller are neatly separate.

3. ASP.NET Web Forms: Because of this coupled behavior, automated testing is really difficult.
3. ASP.NET MVC: Testability is key feature in ASP.NET MVC.

4. ASP.NET Web Forms: Statefulness has a lots of problem for web environment in case of excessively large viewstate. Large viewstate means increase in page size.
4. ASP.NET MVC: As controller and view are not dependent and also no viewstate concept in ASP.NET MVC, so output is very clean.	

5. ASP.NET WebForms model follows a Page Life cycle.
5. No Page Life cycle like WebForms. Request cycle is simple in ASP.NET MVC model.

6. In ASP.NET Web Forms, minimal knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS is required.
6. In MVC, detailed knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS is required.

7. ASP.NET Web Forms: Limited control over HTML, JavaScript and CSS. 
7. ASP.NET MVC: Full control over HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

8. ASP.NET WebForms is RAD(Rapid Application Development) approach.
8. ASP.NET MVC is a step back. For developers decrease in productivity.

9. ASP.NET Web Forms is good for small scale applications with limited team size.
9. ASP.NET MVC is better as well as recommended approach for large-scale applications where different teams are working together.
